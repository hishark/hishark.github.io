就老看他
其实也不胖啦
但是就
很可爱
笑起来更可爱hhh</p>
<h4 id="original-text">ORIGINAL TEXT</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a <strong><code>rut</code></strong>, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American <strong><code>philosopher</code></strong>, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you&rsquo;ve always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out 30 days is just about <strong><code>the right amount of time</code></strong> to add a new habit or subtract a habit &ndash; like watching the news &ndash; from your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. The first was, <strong><code>instead of the months flying by, forgotten</code></strong>, the time was much more <strong><code>memorable</code></strong>. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. I went from <strong><code>desk-dwelling computer nerd</code></strong> to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even last year, <strong><code>I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro</code></strong>, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I also figured out that if you really want something <strong><code>badly</code></strong> enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, <strong><code>tens of thousands of</code></strong> people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, <strong><code>from scratch</code></strong>, in 30 days. It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did. By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you&rsquo;ve written your words for the day. You might be <strong><code>sleep-deprived</code></strong>, but you&rsquo;ll finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American novel? No. I wrote it in a month. It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don&rsquo;t have to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a computer scientist.&rdquo; No, no, if I want to, I can say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a novelist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So here&rsquo;s one last thing I&rsquo;d like to mention. I learned that when I made small, <strong><code>sustainable</code></strong> changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. In fact, they&rsquo;re <strong><code>a ton of</code></strong> fun. But they&rsquo;re less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my question to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and <strong><code>give it a shot</code></strong>! For the next 30 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks.</p>
