#### ORIGINAL TEXT
>A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a **`rut`**, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American **`philosopher`**, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out 30 days is just about **`the right amount of time`** to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life.

>There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. The first was, **`instead of the months flying by, forgotten`**, the time was much more **`memorable`**. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. I went from **`desk-dwelling computer nerd`** to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun!

>Even last year, **`I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro`**, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.

>I also figured out that if you really want something **`badly`** enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, **`tens of thousands of`** people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, **`from scratch`**, in 30 days. It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did. By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. You might be **`sleep-deprived`**, but you'll finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American novel? No. I wrote it in a month. It's awful.

>But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, "I'm a computer scientist." No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."

>So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned that when I made small, **`sustainable`** changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick. There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. In fact, they're **`a ton of`** fun. But they're less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this.

>So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and **`give it a shot`**! For the next 30 days.

>Thanks.

#### MY DICTATION
>a few years ago
i feel like i was stuck in a rut
so i decided to ~~follow and~~ footsteps of the great american ~~pholocipal~~ ~~mogen spoloc~~
and try sth new for 30 days
the idea is actually pretty simple
think about sth you've always ~~wanna~~ to add to your life
and try it for the next 30 days
~~it's~~ turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time
to add a new habit or subtract a habit like watching the news from your life

>there's a few things i~~'ve~~ learned while doing this 30-day challenges
the first was instead of the ~~month~~ flying by forgotten 
the time was much more memorable
this was part of challenge i did to take a picture everyday for a month
and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day
i also noticed that as i started to do more and harder 30-day challenges
my self-confidence grew
i went from ~~this dwelling~~ computer ~~nord~~ to ~~a~~ kind of guy who bikes to work
for fun

>even last year
i ~~xxx packing~~ up ~~a mount kilomixxxx~~ the highest mountain in africa
i would never have been that ~~adventures~~ before i started my 30-day challenges

>i also figured out that if you really want sth badly enough
you can do anything ~~in~~ 30 days
have you ever ~~wanna~~ to write a novel?
every november ~~10th~~ of thousands of people try to write ~~a~~ 50000-word novel from scratch in 30 days
it turns out 
all you have to do is write 1667 words a day for a month
so i did
by the way the secret is not to go to sleep until you ~~xxxx~~ your words for the day
you might be sleep-deprived but you'll finish your novel

>now is my book the next great american novel?
no!!! 
i wrote it in a month!!!
it's awful!!!
but for the rest of my life if i meet ~~XXX~~ at a TED party
i dont have to say
i'm a computer scientists
nono
if i want to
i can say
i'm a novelist
*he is soooo cute there*

>so here is one last thing i'd like to mention
i learned that when i made small sustainable changes
~~since~~ i could keep doing
they~~'ll~~ more likely to stick
there is nothing wrong with big ~~quick~~ challenges
in fact 
~~there~~ are a ton of fun 
but they are less likely to stick
when i ~~give~~ up sugar for 30 days 
day 31 ~~look~~ like this
*many sweets*

>so here is my question to you
what r u waiting for?
i guarantee you ~~that~~ the next 30 days are going to pass
whether you like it or not
so why not think about sth you have always wanted to try
and give it a shot for the next 30 days,thx
