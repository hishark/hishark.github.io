`Nothing with a face Monday through Friday. On the weekend, your choice. Simple.`

#### ORIGINAL TEXT
>About a year ago, I asked myself a question: "Knowing what I know, why am I not a vegetarian?" After all, I'm one of the green guys: I grew up with **`hippie`** parents in a **`log cabin`**. I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this **`stuff`**. I knew that eating a **`mere`** hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a **`third`**. Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm **`conditions`** that we, **`hypocritically`**, wouldn't even consider for our own cats, dogs and other pets. Environmentally, meat, amazingly, causes more emissions than all of transportation combined: cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it. And beef production **`uses`** 100 times the water that most vegetables do.

>I also knew that I'm not alone. We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the **`50s`**. So what was once the special little side **`treat`** now is the main, much more regular. So really, any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to **`go vegetarian`**. Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk -- **`tucking into a big old steak`**.

>So why was I **`stalling`**? I realized that what I was being **`pitched`** was a **`binary solution`**. It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian, and I guess I just wasn't quite ready. Imagine your last hamburger. (Laughter) So my common sense, my good intentions, were in conflict with my **`taste buds`**. And I'd **`commit`** to doing it later, and not surprisingly, later never came. Sound familiar?

>So I wondered, might there be a third solution? And I thought about it, and I came up with one. I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great. It's called weekday veg. The name says it all: **`Nothing with a face Monday through Friday. On the weekend, your choice. Simple.`** If you want to take it to the next level, remember, the major **`culprits`** **`in terms of`** environmental damage and health are **`red and processed meats`**. So you want to **`swap those out`** with some good, **`sustainably`** **`harvested`** fish. **`It's structured`**, so it ends up being simple to remember, and it's okay to **`break it here and there`**. After all, cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat **`intake`**.

>The program has been great, weekday veg. My footprint's smaller, I'm **`lessening`** pollution, I feel better about the animals, I'm even saving money. Best of all, I'm healthier, I know that I'm going to live longer, and I've even lost a little weight.

>So, please ask yourselves, for your health, for your **`pocketbook`**, for the environment, for the animals: **`What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?`** After all, if all of us ate **`half as much meat`**, it would be like half of us were vegetarians.

>Thank you.
